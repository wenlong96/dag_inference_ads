# Enhancing Ad Targeting with Inference and Learning in Graphical Models

The digital marketing landscape, particularly within platforms like Meta (Facebook and Instagram),
presents significant challenges for advertisers aiming to maximize their return on advertising dollar.
We are collaborating with a Singapore-based digital marketing company that manages campaigns for
international real estate developers. Each client campaign operates under unique constraints, including
varying budgets, specific target audience preferences, and diverse ad placement strategies. While the
overarching marketing goals might be similar, the execution details often differs, making optimization
complex. Historically, optimizing these campaigns has relied heavily on manual adjustments and
trial-and-error.

The primary objective of this project is to move beyond manual methods by developing a systematic,
data-driven approach to optimize Meta advertising campaigns, with the core goal of minimizing
the Cost-Per-Lead (CPL), a key metric for campaign effectiveness. This involves designing and
implementing an advertising strategy, grounded in uncertainty modeling principles that maximizes
the conversion of potential leads under the specific constraints posed by different clients. The project
leverages annonymized past campaign data over a two year period to build a probabilistic graphical
model capable of predicting campaign outcomes and guiding media buy settings and decisions
